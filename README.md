System Overview: In this case the scenario posed was with a fictional transportation app company that had a malfunctioning workflow in place with notifications that were not fixed properly. The company is known for thier reliable network infrastructure which is critical for maintaining ride-hailing services across hundreds of cities worldwide. The past month a critical network outage in a major city data center went unnoticed for 2 hours because the notification system wasn't working properly, causing widespread service disruptions and affecting thousands of riders and drivers. The incident resulted in significant revenue loss and regulatory scrutiny. The ficitious manager discovered that critical network incidents aren't triggering email notifications to the Network Operations team. Yesterday, someone created a Critical priority incident for a network outage, but no notifications were sent to the team. The system was supposed to automatically alert engineers within minutes of a critical incident being created. The ask is fix the system so that urgent network incidents trigger immediate email notifications to IT engineers, preventing SLA breaches. Your Role: As a junior ServiceNow admin on the IT Operations team, you've been tasked with fixing a critical gap in the incident management system that supports Uber's network infrastructure.

Implementation Steps: Navigating this from the lens of junior ServiceNow admin on the IT Operations team this is how went about fixing a critical gap in the incident managment system. First I identified what was missing from the existing triggger based off the scenario presented. I noticed that there that trigger selection was correct as well as the table however the conditions was where I identified the bottleneck. I removed the exisiting conditions and replaced them with Priority is Critical and Assignment group is Networking Operations. I also amended the action record to ensure the HTML had more details such as a having a targeted title so the network operations group members can recognize immediately the type of ticket it is, as well as making sure the email contains the ticket number and a description of the problem that the user is facing.

Hypothetical AI Scenario: Your company operates globally across multiple time zones. Critical incidents often occur outside business hours when senior engineers aren't available. The current escalation process follows a rigid hierarchy that doesn't account for engineer expertise, current availability, or incident complexity, leading to prolonged resolution times.
Explain how AI agents could enhance incident routing (100-150 words)

Considering this company is global means that ideally there is 24/7, 365 days availability of a resource providing solutions. The foundational elements of AI Agent being able to enhance incident routing is to have access to employee schedules, work times, mean time to resolution for incidents, microsoft teams status, and performance reviews. Then the Agent should filter all elements by geographical region and create a rating system for top performers from all regions with the quickest resolutions times. When an incident is submitted within standard business hours in the users region the Agent will route it to the highest, quickest, and most available via teams status employee based of the rating system and continue down this cadence until an resource is identified to work on the incident. If the incident is submitted outside of standard business hours in the users region it will automatically route to the closest region where business hours are still open and follow the same logic as mentioned prior. Lastly once an incident is assigned by the Agent it will automatically change the microsoft team status of the resource with a tag of busy with incident. In closing overtime the agent will build be able to utilize muscle memory from analyzing the daily tracking of historical patterns by region for continuos improvement.
